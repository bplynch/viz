        <div class="title">Party Lines</div>
        In the U.S's two-party system, almost all candidates are elected from either the Democrat Party (blue) or Republican Party (red).  In the last four elections, an third-party candidate has never carried a county in the Presidential election.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">The Electorate</div>
        Democratic counties tend to be larger but fewer than Republican counties;  Seen here, votes for Democratic candidates are concentrated in larger counties, whereas votes for Republicans are spread out across smaller counties.

        <div class="title">Swing Counties</div>
        Some counties are won by the slimmest of margins.  Those colored purple are tight races (within 2%) that may could be swung next time around.
